12b Definition of and rationale for test positivity cut-offs or result categories of the reference standard, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory Not applicable

13a Whether clinical information and reference standard results were available to the performers/readers of the index test Not applicable

13b Whether clinical information and index test results were available to the assessors of the reference standard Not applicable

Analysis 14 Methods for estimating or comparing measures of diagnostic accuracy Not applicable

15 How indeterminate index test or reference standard results were handled Not applicable

The article reviewed is an umbrella review and does not fit the criteria for a diagnostic accuracy study as outlined by the STARD 2015 checklist. Therefore, the checklist items are not applicable to this type of study. The STARD checklist is specifically designed for studies that evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of medical tests, and the reviewed article does not fall into this category. Instead, it is a synthesis of systematic reviews related to cognitive impairment in people with schizophrenia, focusing on the domains of cognition impaired and associated factors.
