The article reviewed is an umbrella review of cognitive impairment in people with schizophrenia and does not fit the criteria for a study of diagnostic accuracy as outlined in the STARD 2015 checklist. Therefore, none of the items on the checklist are applicable to this article. The checklist is designed for diagnostic accuracy studies that evaluate the ability of one or more medical tests to correctly classify study participants as having a target condition. Since the article in question is a review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, it does not involve the assessment of a diagnostic test or index test against a reference standard, which is the focus of the STARD checklist.
