Please note that the STARD checklist is specifically designed for studies of diagnostic accuracy, which the reviewed article is not. Therefore, many items on the checklist are marked as "Not applicable." The article is a basic science study investigating the mechanisms of adipogenesis in fibro-adipogenic progenitors after rotator cuff tears.
