INTRODUCTION

3 Scientific and clinical background, including the intended use and clinical role of the index test No

METHODS

Study design 5 Whether data collection was planned before the index test and reference standard were performed (prospective study) or after (retrospective study) No

Participants 6 Eligibility criteria No

7 On what basis potentially eligible participants were identified (such as symptoms, results from previous tests, inclusion in registry) No

8 Where and when potentially eligible participants were identified (setting, location and dates) No

9 Whether participants formed a consecutive, random or convenience series No

Test methods 10a Index test, in sufficient detail to allow replication No

10b Reference standard, in sufficient detail to allow replication No

11 Rationale for choosing the reference standard (if alternatives exist) No

12a Definition of and rationale for test positivity cut-offs or result categories of the index test, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory No

12b Definition of and rationale for test positivity cut-offs or result categories of the reference standard, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory No

13a Whether clinical information and reference standard results were available to the performers/readers of the index test No

13b Whether clinical information and index test results were available to the assessors of the reference standard No

Analysis 14 Methods for estimating or comparing measures of diagnostic accuracy No

15 How indeterminate index test or reference standard results were handled No

16 How missing data on the index test and reference standard were handled No

17 Any analyses of variability in diagnostic accuracy, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory No

18 Intended sample size and how it was determined No

RESULTS

Participants 19 Flow of participants, using a diagram No

20 Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of participants No

21a Distribution of severity of disease in those with the target condition No

22 Time interval and any clinical interventions between index test and reference standard No

Test results 23 Cross tabulation of the index test results (or their distribution) by the results of the reference standard No

24 Estimates of diagnostic accuracy and their precision (such as 95% confidence intervals) No

25 Any adverse events from performing the index test or the reference standard No

DISCUSSION

26 Study limitations, including sources of potential bias, statistical uncertainty, and generalisability No

The article reviewed is a comprehensive review of diagnostic strategies for COVID-19 and does not report on a specific study of diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, the checklist items are not applicable to this type of article. The article discusses various diagnostic methods, including RT-PCR, rapid antigen and antibody tests, immunoenzymatic serological tests, and others, but it does not present original research data or a specific study design that would require reporting according to the STARD checklist.
