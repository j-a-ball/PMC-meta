	15	Cohort study—Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures over time	N/A
	Main results
	16	(a) Give unadjusted estimates and, if applicable, confounder-adjusted estimates and their precision (eg, 95% confidence interval). Make clear which confounders were adjusted for and why they were included	Yes

	Discussion
	Key results
	18	Summarise key results with reference to study objectives	Yes
	Limitations
	19	Discuss limitations of the study, taking into account sources of potential bias or imprecision. Discuss both direction and magnitude of any potential bias	Yes
	Interpretation
