The ARRIVE Essential 10 
Section/line  
Item Recommendation 
Study design 1 a. The groups being compared are RCT-FAPs and ATT-FAPs, with control groups being the respective negative controls (RC-NC and AT-NC). 
b. The experimental unit is a single animal (mouse). 
Sample size 2 a. The exact number of experimental units allocated to each group is specified in the figures (n = 3-6 for various tests). The total number of animals used is not explicitly stated. 
b. The sample size decision is not explicitly described, nor is there an a priori sample size calculation reported. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria 3 a. Criteria for including and excluding animals or experimental units are not explicitly described. 
b. Exclusions of animals, experimental units, or data points are not reported. 
c. The exact value of n in each experimental group is reported in the figure legends. 
Randomisation 4 a. Randomisation to control and treatment groups is mentioned (BML-284 group and control group), but the method used to generate the randomisation sequence is not described. 
b. Strategies to minimise potential confounders are not explicitly described. 
Blinding 5 Blinding is mentioned in the statistical analysis section, stating that experiments were assessed and analyzed by two independent investigators in a blinded manner. 
Outcome measures 6 a. Outcome measures assessed include fatty infiltration, triglyceride measurement, gait analysis, treadmill test, and various molecular analyses. 
b. The primary outcome measure is not explicitly specified. 
Statistical methods 7 a. Statistical methods used for each analysis are described, including Student t-test and RNA-seq analysis. Software used is not specified. 
b. Methods to assess whether the data met the assumptions of the statistical approach are not described. 
Experimental animals 8 a. Details of the animals used are provided, including species (C57BL/6 mice), sex (male), and age (twelve-week-old). 
b. Further relevant information such as health/immune status, genetic modification status, genotype, and previous procedures are not provided. 
Experimental procedures 9 a. Procedures are described in enough detail to allow replication, including the establishment of RCT and ATT animal models, muscle harvest, cell sorting, and cell culture. 
b. Timing of procedures such as tendon injury and subsequent analyses are provided. 
c. Location details such as specific laboratory or facility are not provided. Acclimatisation periods are not mentioned. 
d. Rationale for procedures is provided in the context of the study's aim to investigate FAPs' role in fatty infiltration after tendon injury. 
Results 10 a. Summary/descriptive statistics for each experimental group are reported, including measures of variability. 
b. Effect size with a confidence interval is not reported. 

The Recommended Set 
Abstract 11 The abstract provides a summary of the research objectives, animal species, key methods, principal findings, and study conclusions. 
Background 12 a. Sufficient scientific background is included to understand the rationale and context for the study. 
b. The relevance of the animal species and model to the scientific objectives and human biology is explained. 
Objectives 13 The research question and objectives are clearly described. Specific hypotheses being tested are implied but not explicitly stated. 
Ethical statement 14 The name of the ethical review committee and approval number are provided. 
Housing and husbandry 15 Details of housing and husbandry conditions are not provided. 
Animal care and monitoring 16 a. Interventions to reduce pain, suffering, and distress are not described. 
b. Adverse events are not reported. 
c. Humane endpoints and monitoring frequency are not mentioned. 
Interpretation/scientific implications 17 a. Interpretation of the results is provided, considering the study objectives and hypotheses, current theory, and other relevant studies. 
b. Study limitations are not explicitly discussed. 
Generalisability/translation 18 The potential generalisability of the findings to other species or experimental conditions, including relevance to human biology, is discussed. 
Protocol registration 19 A statement regarding protocol registration is not provided. 
Data access 20 A statement describing if and where study data are available is not provided. 
Declaration of interests 21 a. No declaration of potential conflicts of interest is provided. 
b. Funding sources are listed, but the role of the funders in the design, analysis, and reporting of the study is not described.
