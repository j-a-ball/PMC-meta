Please note that many items in the STARD checklist are not applicable to the reviewed article because it is not a study of diagnostic accuracy but an economic evaluation of an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. The STARD checklist is designed for diagnostic accuracy studies, and therefore, many of its items do not pertain to the type of study being reviewed. The checklist has been filled out to the best of my ability given the content and focus of the article.
