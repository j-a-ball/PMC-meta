Please note that the checklist is filled out based on the information provided in the article. Some items are marked as "Not applicable" because the article format does not include an abstract section that would typically contain those elements. Other items are marked as "Not reported" because the article does not explicitly mention these details. The checklist assumes that the article is a complete case report as published, and the checklist is filled out accordingly.
