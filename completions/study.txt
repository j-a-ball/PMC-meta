TITLE OR ABSTRACT

1 Identification as a study of diagnostic accuracy using at least one measure of accuracy (such as sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, or AUC) Not applicable (The study is not a diagnostic accuracy study)

ABSTRACT

2 Structured summary of study design, methods, results, and conclusions Page 1

INTRODUCTION

3 Scientific and clinical background, including the intended use and clinical role of the index test Page 1

4 Study objectives and hypotheses Page 1

METHODS

Study design 5 Whether data collection was planned before the index test and reference standard were performed (prospective study) or after (retrospective study) Page 2

Participants 6 Eligibility criteria Page 2

7 On what basis potentially eligible participants were identified (such as symptoms, results from previous tests, inclusion in registry) Page 2

8 Where and when potentially eligible participants were identified (setting, location and dates) Page 2

9 Whether participants formed a consecutive, random or convenience series Not reported

Test methods 10a Index test, in sufficient detail to allow replication Page 2

10b Reference standard, in sufficient detail to allow replication Not applicable (The study does not have a reference standard as it is not a diagnostic accuracy study)

11 Rationale for choosing the reference standard (if alternatives exist) Not applicable

12a Definition of and rationale for test positivity cut-offs or result categories of the index test, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory Page 2

12b Definition of and rationale for test positivity cut-offs or result categories of the reference standard, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory Not applicable

13a Whether clinical information and reference standard results were available to the performers/readers of the index test Not applicable

13b Whether clinical information and index test results were available to the assessors of the reference standard Not applicable

Analysis 14 Methods for estimating or comparing measures of diagnostic accuracy Not applicable

15 How indeterminate index test or reference standard results were handled Not applicable

16 How missing data on the index test and reference standard were handled Page 2

17 Any analyses of variability in diagnostic accuracy, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory Not applicable

18 Intended sample size and how it was determined Not reported

RESULTS

Participants 19 Flow of participants, using a diagram Page 2 (Figure 1)

20 Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of participants Page 3 (Table 1)

21a Distribution of severity of disease in those with the target condition Not applicable

21b Distribution of alternative diagnoses in those without the target condition Not applicable

22 Time interval and any clinical interventions between index test and reference standard Not applicable

Test results 23 Cross tabulation of the index test results (or their distribution) by the results of the reference standard Not applicable

24 Estimates of diagnostic accuracy and their precision (such as 95% confidence intervals) Not applicable

25 Any adverse events from performing the index test or the reference standard Not reported

DISCUSSION

26 Study limitations, including sources of potential bias, statistical uncertainty, and generalisability Page 8

27 Implications for practice, including the intended use and clinical role of the index test Page 8

Please note that the STARD checklist is specifically designed for reporting diagnostic accuracy studies. Since the article reviewed is an observational study evaluating the association between passive smoking and vitamin D deficiency in children, many items on the STARD checklist are not applicable. The checklist has been completed to the best of my ability based on the content of the article provided.
