Study Objectives: Lost productivity caused by insomnia is a common and costly problem for employers. Although evidence for the efficacy of Internet-based  cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) already exists, little is known about its economic effects. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness  and cost-benefit of providing iCBT-I to symptomatic employees from the employer’s perspective. 
Methods: School teachers (N = 128) with clinically significant insomnia symptoms and work-related rumination were randomized to guided iCBT-I or a  waitlist-control-group, both with access to treatment as usual. Economic data were collected at baseline and 6-mo follow-up. We conducted (1) a cost effectiveness analysis with treatment response (Reliable Change [decline of 5.01 points] and Insomnia Severity Index < 8 at 6-month follow-up) as the  
outcome and (2) a cost-benefit analysis. Because both analyses were performed from the employer’s perspective, we focused specifically on absenteeism  and presenteeism costs. Statistical uncertainty was estimated using bootstrapping. 
Results: Assuming intervention costs of €200 ($245), cost-effectiveness analyses showed that at a willingness-to-pay of €0 for each positive treatment  response, there is an 87% probability that the intervention is more cost effective than treatment as usual alone. Cost-benefit analyses led to a net benefit of  €418 (95% confidence interval: −593.03 to 1,488.70) ($512) per participant and a return on investment of 208% (95% confidence interval: −296.52 to 744.35).  The reduction in costs was mainly driven by the effects of the intervention on presenteeism and to a lesser degree by reduced absenteeism. Conclusions: Focusing on sleep improvement using iCBT-I may be a cost-effective strategy in occupational health care.

Significance 
The intervention that is evaluated in the current study is based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). It has been tailored to the specific situation of  employees suffering from both insomnia and work stress. The health economic evaluation shows that the Internet-based CBT intervention significantly  reduces insomnia symptoms and costs (due to absenteeism & presenteeism) when compared to nonintervening. Thus, the intervention has a good  probability of being cost-effective from an employer’s perspective. To our knowledge, the current study is the first economic evaluation of Internet-based  CBT for insomnia. Future studies should be conducted with varying types of professions since the present results might only be generalized to teachers  and employees with similar working characteristics. 
INTRODUCTION 
The efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia  (CBT-I) has been proven in a large number of studies and is  therefore recommended as a first-line treatment for insomnia  for various target groups.1–3 The cost-effectiveness of CBT-I,  however, is regarded as a largely neglected research topic.4 
A recent review5 on health economics of insomnia treatment  only includes two studies of behavioral treatment. These  studies both report on the cost-effectiveness of face-to-face  CBT-I from a health service perspective, which means that  they only focused on direct health care costs (e.g., costs for  medical drugs or seeing the doctor).6,7 Bonin et al.6 reported  a probability of 97% for the cost-effectiveness of brief psy choeducational CBT-I community workshops compared to a  waitlist-control group if health policy-makers were willing to  pay 150 Great Britain Pound (GBP) ($196) per one-point im provement in the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Watanabe and  colleagues7 reported brief CBT-I for patients of an outpatient  
clinic suffering from both insomnia and comorbid depression  to be cost-effective at a probability of 95% compared to treat ment as usual if decision makers were willing to pay $60,000  for one additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY). These  studies indicate a potential cost-effectiveness of CBT-I but  they are too few in number to make a robust overall conclusion  about the cost-effectiveness of CBT-I. Given the rising costs of  prevention and treatment of medical diseases on the one hand,  and limited resources on the other hand, health economic eval uations can be an important support tool for various decision  makers to make relevant choices between alternative treatment  strategies. Overall, more research on the cost-effectiveness of  CBT-I based interventions is needed.4,8 
A similar knowledge gap can be observed for Internet-based  interventions for insomnia (iCBT-I). Internet-based interven tions have also been shown to be an effective low-threshold  treatment for insomnia.9–12 They have been introduced to both  potentially increase the reach of CBT-I and to do so at lower

costs than traditional CBT-I.13 However, no evidence is cur rently available for this assumption. The current study is the  first economic evaluation of Internet-based CBT-I. The evalu ation was conducted from an employer’s perspective because  the current CBT-I intervention was an occupational health in tervention focusing on employees experiencing work-related  insomnia. Furthermore, the indirect costs due to productivity  losses at work, e.g., work loss days (absenteeism) and reduced  productivity while at work (presenteeism), are primarily rele vant to the employer14 and especially substantial with regard to  insomnia as shown by a number of epidemiologic studies.15,16 
The indirect costs, i.e. production losses, are assumed to  outweigh those of direct and indirect medical care costs with  an estimated ratio of 1:3.15 For US workers, Kessler et al.16 ob served annual costs of $91.7 billion solely due to presenteeism  and absenteeism, and presenteeism accounted for two-thirds  of these costs. Therefore, we assume that presenteeism will  also account for most of the costs and cost reductions in this  economic evaluation. 
Based on the aforementioned findings researchers have  emphasized the need for economic evaluations of insomnia  interventions to take the “employer’s perspective”.16,17 From  this perspective, analyses imply that the employer pays for the  costs due to presenteeism/absenteeism and for the intervention  costs and benefits from the potential savings due to reduced  presenteeism/absenteeism. Reporting the probability to which  Internet-based CBT-I may save costs with regard to workplace  productivity16,18 could inform employers on how to best spend  their limited resources in occupational health care.19 
With regard to the form of economic evaluation relevant to  an employer, two types of analyses can be distinguished19: first,  a cost-benefit analysis providing a return on investment (ROI)  by relating costs (e.g., intervention costs) to consequences  (e.g., reduced presenteeism and absenteeism), both measured  in monetary units, and second, a cost-effectiveness analysis  that takes costs and consequences (intervention, presenteeism,  and absenteeism) both measured in monetary units and relates  them to an effect outcome (e.g., significant improvement of in somnia symptoms) measured in natural units. 
To the best of our knowledge no published cost-benefit  or cost-effectiveness analyses from an employer’s perspec tive exist for either face-to-face or Internet-based CBT for  employees with insomnia. However, there are a number of  published economic evaluations of occupational health inter ventions for other conditions than insomnia such as depression  that are conducted from the employer’s perspective: 
A large systematic review20 (n = 51 studies) on the cost-benefit  of face-to-face workplace health promotion programs to em ployers comprised evidence on ROIs of various interventions  and indications, ranging from obesity reduction, smoking ces sation, and productivity enhancement programs. The authors  found a positive overall ROI of 138% ($1.38 for every dollar  invested). However, results were mixed because ROI heavily  varied across studies depending on methodology, scope of the  program, sample size, and study quality. Better study quality  was found in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) correlated  with smaller ROIs: The RCTs included (n = 12) exhibited a  negative ROI, −0.22 ± 2.41. 
With regard to Internet-based occupational health interven tions, the first economic evaluation in this area was recently  published by Geraedts and collegues.21 They targeted em ployees with depressive symptoms. Their cost-effectiveness  analysis showed that the intervention had a probability of 95%  of being cost-effective if the employer would be willing to pay  3,500 euro for an additional clinically meaningful change in  depressive symptoms. The authors did not recommend the in tervention to employers cost-wise because they regarded 3,500  euro as being too high for the employer to pay and because  cost-benefit analyses showed only a moderate probability of  positive financial return (66%). 
The health economic evaluation of the iCBT-I intervention,  which we present here, was conducted parallel to an RCT on  the efficacy of Internet-based CBT-I.22 As shown in a previ ously published article on that trial, the intervention signifi cantly reduced insomnia symptoms among employees (large  effect, with Cohen’s d = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]:  1.06 – 1.84), with 42.2% of participants in the intervention  group being symptom-free at 6-month follow-up (vs. 6.3% in  the control group).23 The current evaluation investigates the  probability of Internet-based CBT to be cost-effective and  cost-beneficial from the employer’s perspective with a focus  on productivity loss in terms of absenteeism and presenteeism  among employees. 
METHODS 
Design 
The current health economic evaluation followed guidelines  from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and  Outcomes Research task force report on good research prac tices for cost-effectiveness analysis alongside clinical trials  (ISPOR RCT-CEA) and the recommendations of the Con solidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standard  (CHEERS).24 
The study design is described in detail in the study pro tocol.22 In brief, the study was designed as an evaluation of  efficacy with a health-economic evaluation alongside a ran domized trial with two parallel groups. Randomization was  performed using an automated web-based program (randomi sation.eu). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of  the Philipps University of Marburg (Nr.: 2013-01K) and regis tered as DRKS00004700 in the German Clinical Trial Register  (DRKS). 
Procedures 
Adult schoolteachers were recruited via mailings to schools  from March to September 2013. Outcomes were assessed at  baseline and at 2- and 6-mo follow-up. In total, 128 currently  employed schoolteachers with clinically significant insomnia  symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] > 14) and elevated  work-related rumination (Irritation scale, subscale “Cognitive  Irritation” > 14) were randomly allocated to either the guided  GET.ON Recovery intervention group (IG) or a waitlist con trol group (CG) in a ratio of 1:1, both with unrestricted access  to treatment as usual. Exclusion criteria were: (1) currently  receiving psychological help for insomnia and (2) showing

suicidal ideation, for which item 9 from the Beck Depression  Inventory II (BDI II)25 was used. 
Interventions 
The Internet-based CBT-I intervention (GET.ON Re covery22,23) has been specifically tailored for stressed and  sleepless employees. It mainly uses CBT-I methods such as  sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep hygiene, and cogni tive interventions,26 supplemented by techniques effective in  reducing work stress and fostering mental detachment from  work-related problems derived from behavioral activation,27 metacognitive therapy,28 gratitude research,29 and research on  boundary management.30 The intervention has been shown to  be effective in a guided self-help23 and pure self-help31 format.  It has also been shown that the intervention’s effects on in somnia severity were mediated by both a reduction in perse verative cognitions and sleep effort. Additionally, an increase  in number of recovery activities per week was found to be  associated with lower perseverative cognitions, which in turn  led to a reduction in insomnia severity.31 The intervention con sisted of six 1-w modules. The participants in the intervention  group received email feedback on every completed module by  trained clinical psychologists (e-coaches) following a manual  to ensure a standardized procedure of coaching. E-coaches  also provided email reminders if participants did not complete  a module within 1 w. E-coaches were advised that the total  amount of support a subject should receive was to be around  3 h total, with a maximum of 30 min per session, so that the  guidance could be kept at a minimal level and comparability  of the participants was maximized. A clinical psychologist su pervised the e-coaches. 
Individuals in the control group eventually did receive the  intervention (without coaching) after the last assessment at  6-mo follow-up for ethical reasons. 
All study participants had unrestricted access to treatment  as usual. Treatment as usual for elevated insomnia symptoms  usually indicates visits to the general practitioner (GP) fol lowed by more intensive interventions such as CBT and sleep  medication if insomnia symptoms persevere or worsen. 
Measures 
Clinical Outcome 
The primary clinical outcome for the cost-effectiveness  analysis was the number of participants with a positive treat ment response at 6-mo follow-up using the ISI.32 Participants  were labeled as “having a positive treatment response” ac cording to Jacobson and Truax33, by combining two criteria:  a sufficiently large change in the widely used Reliable Change  Index (RCI) and ISI being below a certain cutoff score. There fore, treatment response was defined if the ISI score: (1) de creased by 5.01 points on the ISI and (2) fell below the cutoff  score of 8 in the ISI, which classifies a participant as being  symptom-free.34 The seven items of the ISI are answered on  a five-point Likert scale with the total score ranging from 0  to 28. The ISI is a commonly used instrument in CBT-I re search and has been validated as a Web-based measure.35 At  screening, the cutoff score of ≥ 15 was used to indicate clinical  
insomnia.32 Participants with a score < 15 were excluded. In  our sample, internal consistency was α = 0.91. 
Costs 
Costs were calculated in euros (€) for the reference year 2013.  Main results were translated into US dollars using the Organi zation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD)  Purchasing Power Parities (PPP) of 2013.36 PPPs are the rates of  currency conversion eliminating the differences in price levels  between countries and therefore correcting for the purchasing  power of different currencies. 
Absenteeism and Presenteeism 
Cost data were measured with the Trimbos/iMTA question naire for costs associated with psychiatric illness (TiC-P37), a  retrospective (covering the previous three months) self-report  questionnaire. The TiC-P is a widely used, feasible, and reli able instrument for collecting data on health care utilization  and productivity losses in patients with mild to moderate  mental health conditions.38 Participants were instructed to  specify all productivity losses. 
Costs due to absenteeism were based on the human capital  approach.39 In order to measure absenteeism, participants were  asked how many days they had been absent from work during  the past 3 mo (work loss days). To measure costs, work loss  days were then multiplied to the participant’s average gross  daily wage based on their self-reported monthly salary. 
Production losses due to presenteeism were measured by  asking participants to report how many days during the past  3 mo they went to work even though they were bothered by  their health problems. The number of days was then multiplied  by a self-reported inefficiency score, which ranged between 0  and 1 (where 0 means as efficient as when in good health and  1 means totally inefficient) to obtain workday equivalents lost  to presenteeism. This method is called the Osterhaus method.40 Subsequently, based on self-reported monthly salary, their  gross wages per hour were calculated and were used to calcu late the costs that occurred due to presenteeism.37 
Intervention Costs 
Intervention costs were estimated to be €200 based on the fol lowing subcosts. The costs of providing the training, website  hosting, maintenance, and technical support per person were  obtained by interviewing health care providers about a potential  market price for the intervention when implemented in occupa tional health care. These estimates ranged from €49 to €103.  The more conservative estimation of €103 was used and added  to the costs of the coaches, which were estimated from the av erage monthly salary of a full-time psychologist (€65 for 3 h41).  This estimate was based on the completion of all six modules  by the participants, with the coaches investing 30 minutes per  one feedback per person, resulting in 6 × 30 min per participant.  Although not all participants complete all intervention modules  in Internet-based guided self-help interventions and thus true  costs may differ between participants when implementing the  intervention in practice, we used the highest possible costs,  namely 3 h of coaching per participant. Also, a value-added  tax (VAT) of 19% of €168 was added (€30). It was assumed 
SLEEP, Vol. 39, No. 10, 2016 1771 Economic Evaluation of Internet-Based CBT-I—Thiart et al. 
that all participants did the intervention at home, not at work.  Therefore, opportunity costs due to the time employees spent  working on the intervention were not included. 
To summarize, this leads to a total approximate estimate of  €200 ($245) that an employer would need to pay per participant  for this intervention. 
Analytic Plan 
Means of presenteeism and absenteeism costs are reported in  order to conclude if presenteeism accounts for the larger sum  as expected. In order to provide the probability for a positive fi nancial return the employer could expect, cost-benefit analyses  were conducted comparing the costs the employer would have  to pay (intervention costs) with the benefits he gets (reduced  presenteeism and absenteeism). In order to gather evidence on  the probability for cost-effectiveness of Internet-based CBT  for insomnia at different willingness-to-pay ceilings, we con ducted cost-effectiveness analyses relating all costs (interven tion, presenteeism, and absenteeism) to the clinical outcome  of a significant improvement of insomnia symptoms at 6-mo  follow-up. 
Statistical Analysis 
The current health economic evaluation was conducted along side a RCT that focused on the efficacy of this intervention and  powered accordingly. A sample size of N = 128 was needed  to detect a mean clinical difference between the IG and CG of  d = 0.50 or larger in the primary outcome (ISI) at posttest. Cost  data are usually heavily skewed to the right with large variance  requiring very large sample sizes. Therefore, due to ethical and  feasibility reasons, the study was not powered to statistically  test differences in health economic outcomes. As a result, as  it is common in health economic evaluations alongside clinical  trials, a probabilistic decision-making approach for making  health-economic inferences is used.42 This procedure takes  the uncertainty about all measured parameters into account43,44 and aims at informing decision makers on probabilities rather  than statistical significance. 
Analysis of Costs 
Costs were assessed at baseline (T1) and 6-mo follow-up (T3).  Missing cost data (monthly wage, weekly working hours, pre senteeism days, absenteeism days) at T3 were imputed using a  Markov Chain Monte Carlo multivariate imputation algorithm  (missing data module in IBM SPSS 20) with 100 estimations  per missing value.45 Baseline costs of presenteeism and absen teeism, wage, working hours, age, and sex were used as predic tors. At the 6-mo follow-up, participants were asked to only  report on the previous 3 mo. Therefore, we had to estimate cu mulative costs for each participant during the 6-mo follow-up  period. This was done by calculating the area under the curve  (AUC) of linearly interpolated 1-mo costs46: 
Cost-Benefit Analyses 
In the present study, it was assumed that the employer would  be the one who pays for all the included costs and the one who  benefits from all the savings. Three metrics of cost-benefit  analyses were used to report on the comparison between costs  and benefits for the employer.19 Benefits in this case indicate the  productivity benefits due to reduced presenteeism and absen teeism and can be derived by subtracting absenteeism and pre senteeism costs from the CG from those from the IG. Costs are  the intervention costs that the employer would have to pay for  the online training per employee (estimated at €200). The most  frequently used measures of cost-benefit relations are: (1) the net  benefits (NB = benefits – costs), the money gained after costs  are recovered; (2) the benefit-cost ratio (BCR = benefits / costs),  the money returned for one monetary unit invested; and (3) the  ROI (ROI = [benefits – costs] / costs × 100), the percentage  of profit per monetary unit invested.19 All three measures  are reported. 
To quantify statistical uncertainty, bootstrapped 95% CIs19,47 were estimated around these measures, with 2,500 replications.  Positive financial returns are indicated by the following criteria:  NB > 0, BCR > 1, and ROI > 0%.19,48 In addition to this, the  probability of financial return was estimated by reporting the  proportion of positive bootstrapped financial return estimates. 
Analysis of Cost-Effectiveness 
All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle.  All 128 participants completed the ISI at baseline. Missing  data from the ISI at follow-up (7.2%) were imputed using a  Markov Chain Monte Carlo multivariate imputation algorithm  (missing data module in IBM SPSS 20) with 100 estimations  per missing value.45 
For the cost-effectiveness analyses, costs (presenteeism +  absenteeism + intervention costs) and effects (number of par ticipants with treatment response) were calculated for the 6-mo  period and then costs and outcomes were related to each other.  The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calcu lated according to the following formula: 
ICER = (Costs IG − Costs CG) 
(effects IG − effects CG) 
To adjust the analyses of cost and effect differences for poten tial confounders (e.g., baseline depression, age, sex, and marital  status), seemingly unrelated regression was used. Baseline de pression and marital status were shown to be confounders of the  outcome. Since cost data are usually skewed to the right,42 the  nonparametric bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrapping  method with 2,500 replications was used to handle uncertainty  in the ICER. Bootstrap analyses were done using STATA. In  ICERs, negative ratios generally can mean reduced costs and  positive effects but can also indicate increased costs and nega tive effects. Therefore, figures are used (the so-called cost

mental costs (difference between both groups) are plotted on  the y-axis. If a cost/effect pair (ICER) is located in the north east quadrant (NE-Q), the intervention is more effective but

also more costly as compared to the control condition. In the  southeast quadrant (SE-Q) the intervention is estimated to be  associated with lower costs, while simultaneously achieving  better health effects than the control condition (best possible  outcome). ICERs in the northwest quadrant (NW-Q) indicate  that the intervention is associated with higher costs and worse  outcomes than the control condition. Finally, ICERs in the  southwest Quadrant (SW-Q) point to an intervention being less  effective but also less costly than the control condition. In the  case of the SW-Q and the NE-Q, the amount of money a deci sion maker is willing to pay for one additional positive outcome  is crucial for whether a new intervention is adopted. 
The willingness to pay is displayed in the cost-effectiveness  acceptability curve, which demonstrates the probability that  the intervention is cost-effective compared to treatment as  usual-only, given varying willingness to pay ceilings for the in tervention by potential decision makers, in this case employers. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
Two sensitivity analyses of intervention costs were conducted  in order to assess the robustness of the findings. In the main  analysis, we used intervention costs of €200. However, there  exists uncertainty concerning these costs, as prices may differ  once the intervention is integrated into occupational health care.  Therefore, all analyses were repeated assuming two additional  conditions of 50% (€100) and 150% (€300) intervention costs. 
RESULTS 
Baseline Characteristics 
Table 1 summarizes baseline characteristics; details are de scribed in a previous article.32 
Study Dropouts 
Baseline data were available for all participants. The study at trition rate was low; 7.2% did not fill out the 6-mo follow-up  questionnaires (n = 5 [7.8%] for the IG and n = 10 [15.6%] in  the CG). 
Intervention Use and Costs 
All of the participants (n = 64) in the IG completed the first  three out of six modules of the intervention. Two subjects  dropped out after the third module, and one dropped out after  the fourth module. Reasons reported were “lack of motivation”  
and “lack of time.” Overall, 61 participants (95.3%) completed  all six sessions. 
In Table 2, the mean presenteeism, absenteeism, and inter vention costs are presented for the 6-mo follow-up assessment.  Total costs are reported for both groups and for the differences  between these groups. As Table 2 shows, presenteeism costs  accounted for the highest costs in both groups. 
The mean difference in indirect costs at the 6-mo follow up was €618 per person in favor of the intervention group

([Presenteeism CG + Absenteeism CG] – [Presenteeism IG +  Absenteeism IG]). In the intervention group, each participant  produced costs of €200 (intervention costs), resulting in av erage savings in the first 6 mo of €418 ($512) in comparison to  the control group. 
Cost-Benefit Analyses 
Cost-benefit analyses and related sensitivity analyses are dis played in Table 3. 
With intervention costs at €200 ($245) and per-person costs  at €2,527 ($2,091) in the IG and €2,945 ($3,602) in the CG, the  net benefit was €418 ($512) per participant at 6 mo, the benefit  cost ratio (BCR [benefit/costs]) was 3.1 (95% CI: −1.97 to 8.44).  This indicates that the employer gains €3.1 ($3.7) for every euro  (US dollar) invested. This results in an ROI ([benefits – costs] /  [costs × 100]) of 208.81% (95% CI: −296.51 to 744.35). Since  NB > 0, BCR > 1, and ROI > 0%, financial returns are con sidered positive. However, CIs are wide and contain 0; thus,  cost-benefit lacks statistical significance at a 95% level. The  probability of a positive financial return is 66%. 
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
On average, the IG improved by 9.3 (SD = 5.0) points on the  ISI, and the CG improved by 2.6 (SD = 4.4) points. There were  
more participants in the IG (51 [79.7%]) with reliable improve ment at posttreatment in insomnia severity than in the CG (18  [28.1%]). In the IG, 27 participants were symptom-free by the  6-mo follow-up as indicated by a score of < 8 in the ISI.41 In the  CG, 4 participants were symptom-free. Thus, 42.2% of partici pants were responders in the IG and 6.3% in the CG. 
Cost-effectiveness analyses are displayed in Table 4. The  ICER refers to the difference of mean indirect costs between  the two groups divided by the difference in positive effects  i.e., reliable ISI improvement and symptom-free subjects  (C1 − C0) / (E1 − E0). It is shown that (1) the improvement in re liable ISI was greater in the IG than the CG and resulted in in creased positive treatment responses (42.2% versus 6.3%), and  (2) the intervention group had less indirect cost (€2,527 versus  €2,945). The unadjusted point estimate of the ICER resulted  in savings of −€1,162 (95% CI: −4,041 to 1,690) (−$1,421) for  every participant with a positive treatment response after 6 mo.  Using the 2,500 bootstrapped replicates of the ICER that were  adjusted for baseline depression and marital status, the ICER  was estimated at −€1,512 (95% CI: −4,493 to 1,128) (−$1,849).  Figure 1 shows the cost-effectiveness plane, where each dot  (n = 2,500) stands for one bootstrap replication of the ICER.  The majority of the dots fall in the SE-Q, indicating an 87%  probability that the GET.ON Recovery intervention produces

greater health effects at lower costs compared to the control  condition. 
The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve in Figure 2 shows  that if the employer is willing to pay zero for one positive treat ment response, there is an 87% chance that GET.ON Recovery  is more cost-effective than treatment as usual alone. The 95%  probability threshold is reached at €761 ($931) for one positive  treatment response. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
As Tables 3 and 4 show, sensitivity analyses led to similar re sults. With lower treatment costs (SA1), a positive financial re turn became more likely in the cost-benefit analyses (72%) and  the ICER increased to −€1,806 ($2,209) per additional treat ment response. Even with increased intervention costs of €300,  the intervention has an 81% probability that it produces greater  health effects at lower costs compared to the control condition  with the 95% probability threshold reached at a willingness-to pay of €1,115 ($1,364) per treatment response. 
DISCUSSION 
This economic evaluation performed both cost-effectiveness  and cost-benefit analyses on Internet-based CBT-I compared  to treatment as usual alone in employees with insomnia and  work-related rumination from an employer’s perspective. As  expected, presenteeism was the major cost driver and costs due  to presenteeism and absenteeism decreased relatively more in  the intervention group as compared to the control condition  during the 6-mo follow-up period. 
The cost-benefit analyses showed a positive financial return  with a net benefit of €418 ($512) and a benefit-cost ratio of 3.09  (95% CI: −1.97 to 8.44). This indicates that the employer would  get €3.1 ($3.7) back for every €1 invested. However, CIs were  wide and included zero; therefore, our results lacked statistical  significance on a 95% level. We only found a moderate prob ability of 66% for a positive financial return. 
With regard to the cost-benefit analyses, this work is the  first to investigate CBT for insomnia. However, our results

are comparable to Internet-based occupational health for de pression (P = 63%)21 and score above the average ROI (−0.22  (SD = 2.41) found for RCTs (n = 12) in a large review20 (2014,  n = 51 studies) on the cost-benefit of general workplace health  promotion. 
With regard to the cost-effectiveness analyses, the probability  of the intervention being cost-effective was 87% at a potential  willingness-to-pay of zero. If a payer is willing to pay €243,  €761, or €1,794 for each treatment response, the probability in creases to 90%, 95%, and 99% respectively. Sensitivity analyses  confirmed the robustness of these results. Even with interven tion costs of €300, the probability of cost-effectiveness is > 80%. 
A probability of 87% at a willingness to pay of zero can be  generally perceived as a good result because it exceeds the 50%  probability cutoff and compares favorably to economic evalu ations of CBT-I: Bonin et al.6 found the intervention to have a  probability of only 7% of being cost effective. Watanabe et al.7 
also reported a probability of less than 10% for a willingness to  pay of zero for one additional QALY. A potential explanation  for our relatively good results may be that our study focused  on non-medical indirect costs, which are considered the major  cost-drivers, whereas Bonin et al.6 and Watanabe et al.7 only  focused on direct health care costs from a health service per spective. Other explanations include differences with regard  to the intervention and the costs associated with it, as well as  different outcome measures and another study population. For  example, Bonin et al.6 evaluated brief community workshops  for the general population (universal prevention) while the  present study evaluated Internet-based CBT-I for employees  with elevated symptom severity (indicated prevention). De spite these differences, both studies concluded that CBT-I is  likely to be cost-effective given the anticipated costs decision  makers would be willing to pay. 
Since the present Internet-based CBT-I intervention was  targeted at employees, its cost-effectiveness may also gen erally be compared to that found in occupational health  interventions for other conditions such as depression.21 Ger aedts et al. found a 95% probability of their Internet-based  
SLEEP, Vol. 39, No. 10, 2016 1775 Economic Evaluation of Internet-Based CBT-I—Thiart et al. 
occupational health intervention for depressed employees to  be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of around three times  higher (€3,500) than the one found in this study (€761); there fore, they do not recommend their intervention to employers  in terms of cost savings. 
Comparisons with the afore-mentioned studies should gen erally be interpreted with caution as our evaluation differs  with regard to target group, methodology, perspective, and/ or setting. Moreover, the willingness-to-pay for occupational  health interventions and the acceptability of a certain cost-ef fectiveness probability threshold varies among payers19; there fore, cost-effectiveness needs to be judged by individual payers  and cannot be obtained using the presented cost-acceptability  curve or comparisons to other studies.43,44 
Limitations of our study include the lack of a longer  follow-up period. Although six months is a longer period  than in all previous studies on the cost-effectiveness of  CBT-I, simulation of costs developing over a much longer  period of time may be more useful to show employers the  potential of costs to be reduced. With a longer time horizon  (i.e., 12 or 24 mo) benefits might accumulate. Thus, our re sults have a chance of being too conservative, also given its  focus on only presenteeism and absenteeism. Further work related costs were not included. Given that insomnia is asso ciated with 7.2% of all costly workplace accidents and errors  and 23.7% of all the costs of these incidents,49 the inclusion  of costs other than presenteeism and absenteeism may lead  to higher overall costs and a higher potential for cost savings.  Limitations further include the fact that the sample size may  have been too small to detect statistical significance with  appropriate power in the cost-benefit analyses. In economic  evaluations that are conducted parallel to a clinical trial,  power issues constitute a problem because cost variables  often have a higher variance and generally require greater  sample sizes than clinical evaluations.44 Hence, a probabi listic decision making approach was used.43,44 In addition,  the current evaluation was done from the employer’s per spective; further studies should also include calculations of  cost-utility from the societal perspective. Another limita tion is that participants in this trial were predominantly fe male teachers, which may limit the generalizability for male  teachers. Furthermore, our results may only be generalized  to professions with similar characteristics, such as flexible  working hours, loose boundaries between work and private  life, and work-home interference.50 
Internet-based interventions for mental disorders have  often been introduced as potential cost-saving alternatives  to face-to-face individual or group therapy, but evidence for  this assumption needs to be extended.51 Our study helps shed  light into this by being the first to show the potential cost-ef fectiveness of an Internet-based CBT-I intervention from the  employer’s perspective. 
This evaluation shows two main points regarding sleep im provement through Internet-based CBT-I. First, this interven tion may potentially be a cost-effective strategy in occupational  health care, and second, the cost-savings due to reduced pre senteeism at work outweigh those of absenteeism. This is im portant information for employers willing to primarily target a  
reduction in sick leave by this kind of intervention. The results  of this economic evaluation justify replication of its results  preferably with larger sample sizes with sufficient statistical  power and as well with professionals other than teachers tar geted over longer periods of time. The results of these studies  could inform employers about the benefits of CBT-I based oc cupational health interventions for their employees.
