Abstract 
Objectives The efects of water fossing on dental plaque removal have been suggested, but its ecological impact on dental  plaque microbiota needs further investigation. In addition, whether this plaque control measure by water fossing promotes  the control of halitosis still needs clinical validation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efects of water fossing on  gingival infammation and supragingival plaque microbiota. 
Materials and methods Seventy participants with gingivitis were randomly assigned to control (toothbrushing) and  experimental (toothbrushing+water fossing) groups (n=35). Participants were recalled at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and their  gingival index, sulcus bleeding index, bleeding on probing, dental plaque index, and oral malodor values were measured.  The microbiota of supragingival plaque was further investigated using 16S rRNA sequencing and qPCR. 
Results Sixty-three participants completed all revisits (control: n=33; experimental: n=30). The experimental and control  groups exhibited similar clinical characteristics and dental plaque microbiota at baseline. Adjunctive water fossing efectively  reduced the gingival index and sulcus bleeding index as compared to the toothbrushing control group. The water-fossing  group showed reduced oral malodor at week 12 as compared to the baseline. Consistently, the water-fossing group exhibited  altered dental plaque microbiota at week 12, characterized by a depletion of Prevotella at genus level and Prevotella  intermedia at species level as compared to the toothbrushing control. In addition, the plaque microbiota of water-fossing  group exhibited a more aerobic phenotype, while the control group was more anaerobic. 
Conclusions Daily water fossing can efectively alleviate gingival infammation and reduce oral malodor, possibly by  depleting oral anaerobes and altering the oral microbiota to a more aerobic phenotype. 
Clinical relevance Water fossing adjunctive to toothbrushing efectively alleviated gingival infammation, representing a  promising oral hygiene practice to promote oral health. 
Clinical trial registration The trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn/showp rojen.aspx?proj=61797, #ChiCTR2000038508) on September 23, 2020.

Introduction 
The periodontal diseases are highly prevalent and can afect  up to 90% of the worldwide population [1]. Gingivitis is  the most prevalent form of periodontal disease. According  to the released data from the fourth national oral health  epidemiology survey of China, the prevalence of gingival  bleeding is over 87.4% in middle-aged and elderly people  in China [2]. Gingivitis is typically caused by dental plaque

accumulation. Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, Actinomyces,  Veillonella, and Treponema, and possibly Bacteroides,  Capnocytophaga, and Eikenella, are etiologically involved  [3]. Microbial colonization and participation is sequential,  with the complexity of the associated fora increasing with  time [3]. Other local or systemic etiologic factors such as  defective prosthesis, smoking, and hormones may also  promote plaque deposition and/or predispose the host to  microbial attack [4]. The ecological balance via both inter microbial and host-microbial interactions plays a critical role  in maintaining the gingival tissue health [5]. Disruption of this  homeostatic balance leads to selective outgrowth of species  with potential for destructive infammation, and increases in

the bacterial burden promote gingival infammation in this  condition [5, 6]. Gingivitis is a key risk factor of periodontitis,  and control of gingival infammation is crucial for the primary  prevention of periodontitis [7]. In addition, halitosis, which  shares risk factors with periodontal diseases, is also common  among patients with gingivitis or periodontitis [8]. 
Dental plaque control, typically by toothbrushing, is the  most efective measure for preventing and treating gingivitis  [9]. However, toothbrushing leaves approximately 40% of the  dental plaque on the tooth surface [10]. A toothbrush combined  with interdental cleaning device can achieve sufcient oral  hygiene [10, 11]. Regular fossing can remove up to 80% of  the interproximal plaques as reported by American Dental  Association [12]. Daily use of dental foss can efectively reduce  the gingival infammation and halitosis [13, 14]. However,  regular fossing requires time and skill, limiting its daily use  [15]. Interdental brushes can efectively reduce the dental plaque  between the teeth, and alleviate the gingival infammation [16,  17]. However, interdental brushes can only be used if there is  sufcient space between the teeth, and we should choose the  appropriate diameters; otherwise, the cleaning efciency will be  infuenced and the periodontal tissue may be destroyed [17, 18]. 
The power-driven water fosser, with claims of easy home  use, has become a widely recommended oral hygiene prod uct. Through pulsation and pressure, it disrupts plaque and  removes loosely lodged debris, and can deliver antimicrobial  solutions into the sulcus and interproximal regions [19]. The  efects of water fossing on dental plaque removal and gin givitis management were better than those of regular foss  and interdental brushes [20, 21]. Water fossing adjunctive  to manual toothbrushing can inhibit dental plaque formation  and reduce the levels of pro-infammatory factors, alleviating  gingivitis and reducing periodontitis recurrence as compared  to solely toothbrushing [22-24]. In addition, water fossing  can alleviate gingivitis in orthodontic patients and manage  peri-implant mucositis [25, 26]. With the widespread accept ance and application of water fossing, the safety regarding  its daily use has drawn increasing attention. Studies have  demonstrated that daily use of water fosser for 3 months  did not increase the risk of bacteremia during periodontal  maintenance therapy [27, 28]. In addition, water fossing was  safe to be used on composite restorations with no infuence  on their surface roughness and color stability [29]. 
However, water fossing cannot completely eradicate  dental plaque due to microbial recolonization on the tooth  surface shortly after cleaning [30]. Long-term disturbance  of oral microbiota by measures such as antimicrobial mouth 
wash (chlorhexidine) may have the risk of microbial dys biosis and bacterial resistance [31, 32]. Therefore, the long term efect of water fossing on oral microbial ecology still  needs clinical validation. In addition, whether this plaque  control measure by water fossing promotes the control of  halitosis, which is a common complaint among patients  
with gingivitis, still needs investigation. Here, we conducted  a 12-week prospective clinical trial to investigate the efect  of water fossing on gingival infammation and bleeding,  plaque accumulation, and halitosis in individuals with gin 
givitis, and the ecological impact of water fossing on oral  microbiota was further evaluated. 
Materials and methods 
Study participants 
This article is reported according to CONSORT guidelines  for reporting randomized clinical trials. This study was  approved by the Research Ethics Committee of West China  Hospital of Stomatology (WCHSIRB-D-2020-309) and was  in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki and complied  with Chinese Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations. All  participants were recruited at the West China Hospital of  Stomatology, Sichuan University, and signed informed con sent. The trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial  Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj= 
61797, #ChiCTR2000038508) on September 23, 2020. The participants were aged 18–65 years with no sys temic diseases. All participants had intact Ramjord teeth  (16, 21, 24, 36, 41, 44) in the oral cavity. Participants had  gingivitis, with a modiied gingival index≥1, dental plaque  index≥1.5, and gingival sulcus depth<3 mm [33]. Partici pants were excluded if they had periodontitis, had undergone  surgical/non-surgical periodontal therapy or antibacterial/ hormonal drug therapy in the last 6 weeks, had participated  in other clinical trials within the last 3 months, had an aller gic constitution, or were pregnant [34]. 
Experimental design 
This was a single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial  with a duration of 14 weeks (2-week washout and 12-week  treatment phase) (Fig. 1). The washout phase was introduced  to normalize the oral hygiene habits of participants as also  suggested by Sreenivasan et al. [35]. Participants who met the  inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited in the 2-week  washout phase, and were instructed to brush their teeth with  Bass brushing technique twice daily for 3 min using Crest  herbal crystal toothpaste and a Crest triple care toothbrush  (P&G Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Participants were  asked not to use antibiotics/hormonal drug and have periodontal  therapy during the washout phase. These participants were  re-screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria at  baseline, and then were enrolled in the 12-week treatment phase. 
The sample size was calculated using G*Power 3.1  software and was based on the primary data of gingival  bleeding. Based on inequality and two independent groups 
1 3

Fig. 1 Schematic of study design
(Fisher’s exact test), the sample size was determined to be  60, with an 0.05 alpha level (type II error) and 90% power  (type I error). Considering a 15% dropout rate, 70 partici pants were eventually enrolled in this study. 
The participants were randomly allocated to two groups  (n=35/group) using a computer-generated randomization  list. The control group only brushed their teeth with Bass  brushing technique twice daily for 3  min using above 
mentioned toothbrush and toothpaste, but the experimen tal group was additionally instructed to use a Bixdo P50  water fosser (Bixdo SH Healthcare Technology Co., Ltd.,  Shanghai, China) to irrigate all the teeth in the oral cav ity with water for 3 min immediately after toothbrushing.  Participants were recalled at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and their  modiied gingival index, sulcus bleeding index, bleeding on  probing (BOP), dental plaque index, and oral malodor values  were determined. Supragingival plaque samples were also  collected. Participants were asked to refrain from brushing,  fossing, eating, and drinking anything other than water for  4 h prior to sample collection visits. The names and groups  of the participants were covered for blinding to those collect ing samples or clinical assessments. Over the experimental  
period, participants received weekly oral hygiene instruction  and supervised plaque removal using the devices assigned  for each group. 
Periodontal examination and supragingival plaque  collection 
Periodontal examination was performed by an operator,  previously trained until reaching a low intra-operator  variability, using an UNC-15 periodontal probe with a  controlled (ca. 0.25 N) force. The gingival sulcus depth  (distance from the gingival margin to the bottom of the  gingival sulcus, evaluated at each tooth surface, for all  teeth), modiied Loe–Silness gingival index (assessment  of gingival color, texture, and bleeding tendency, evaluated  at four speciic sites of each tooth), sulcus bleeding index  (assessment of gingival bleeding, with a score of 0–5 per  site), BOP (recorded based on the presence or absence of  bleeding up to 20 s after probing at the experimental sites),  and dental plaque index (evaluation of the presence of plaque,  with a score of 0–5 per site) were measured [36]. After  drying saliva of the collection site, supragingival plaque  samples were collected from facial and lingual sites of all  six Ramjord teeth of each subject, by using a sterile curette.  Scraped plaque was immediately transferred to and dispersed  in 1×phosphate-bufered saline in a sterile microcentrifuge  tube. The plaque sample was divided into three parts after  vibration and stored at−80 °C until analysis. 
Oral malodor measurement using a halimeter 
Oral malodor values were measured using a halimeter (RH 17 K; Interscan Co., Chatsworth, CA). Subjects refrained  from any oral activity, such as food intake, for at least 2 h  pre-measurement. The subjects were instructed to close their  mouths for 3 min (using only nasal breathing) before every  measurement, followed by placing a straw, connected to the  halimeter, 4-cm deep into their mouth. The measurement  was performed automatically, and the mean value of three  consecutive measurements was used for analysis [37]. 
16S rRNA sequencing 
Barcoded 16S rRNA amplicon (V3–V4 regions) sequencing  was performed using Illumina MiSeq technology (Person albio, Shanghai, China) and primers F (5′-ACTCCTACG GGAGGCAGCA-3′) and R (5′-TCGGACTACHVGGG TWTCTAAT-3′). A unique 12-mer tag for each DNA  sample was added to the 5′-end of both primers to allow  pooling of multiple samples in one run. The PCR products  were visualized on a 3% agarose gel, gel puriied, quanti ied with a Pico-Green kit, pooled in an equimolar ratio,  assessed using an Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100 (Invitrogen,  
1 3 
4570 Clinical Oral Investigations (2023) 27:4567–4577 
Carlsbad, CA), and sequenced. Sequences were trimmed  using Trimmomatic 2 based on a quality score of 20, and  pair-end reads were merged into longer reads using FLASH  3. Unqualiied sequences were removed if they were too  short or if they contained ambiguous residues. Operational  taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered using Usearch (ver 
sion 7.1, http://drive5.com/uparse/) at a 97% similarity level.  The inal OTUs were generated based on clustering results.  The raw sequencing data were deposited in the public data base Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 
Traces/sra) with accession no. PRJNA861384. Before bioinformatic analysis, sequencing reads of all  samples were standardized by rarefying OTU tables to the  minimum read number. Analyses were performed using the  online Majorbio Cloud Platform (www.majorbio.com) [38].  The Kruskal–Wallis H and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were  used to compare diferences in taxa. Alpha diversity was cal culated in terms of Chao, Shannon, and Simpson indices and  was compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Beta diver sity was assessed by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA)  or non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis  using weighted-unifrac distance and Adonis with 999 per mutations. Analysis of similarity values and heatmaps were  constructed using R (version 3.3.1; https://www.r-project. org/) “vegan” (version 2.4–3) package. Linear discriminant  analysis (LDA) of the efect size (LEfSe) was performed to  identify the signiicant taxa that most likely explained the  diferences between groups, with a threshold LDA score of  2. Bugbase was used for the predictions of the functional  profile of a microbial community based on 16S rDNA  sequence data. BugBase is able to predict seven phenotype  types, including gram-positive, gram-negative, bioilm form ing, pathogenic, mobile element containing, oxygen utiliz ing, and oxidative stress tolerant. A p value of<0.05 was  considered statistically signiicant in the current study. 
Bacterial quantifcation 
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to  quantify dental plaque bacteria. qPCR ampliication was per formed using the CFX96 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).  The 25-μl reaction mixture contained the SYBR reaction  mix (TaKaRa, Kusatsu, Japan), template DNA (100 ng), and  forward and reverse primers (500 nM each). Thermal cycling  conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for  30 s, followed by 40 cycles each consisting of 95 °C for 15 s,  and 60 °C for 30 s. Threshold cycle (CT) values were deter 
mined, and the relative abundance was calculated based on  the 2−ΔΔCT method. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacte rium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and  Prevotella intermedia were quantiied using primers listed in  Table S1. Each sample was examined in triplicate. 
Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis of data other than 16S rRNA sequenc ing was performed using SPSS software (version 16.0;  SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and GraphPad Prism 8 (Graph Pad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Categorical variables are  presented as natural frequencies, and continuous variables  as mean±standard deviation. The clinical characteristics  of the participants were analyzed using Kruskal–Wallis  (with Dunn–Bonferroni post hoc) or chi-squared tests.  Within-group and between-group diferences in gingival,  sulcus bleeding, and dental plaque indices, BOP%, and  oral malodor values were analyzed by repeated measure  (RM) ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests  and Student’s t tests, respectively. Other data were ana lyzed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s test  or the Student–Newman–Keuls test to compare all pairs  of groups. Data were considered signiicantly diferent if  the two-tailed p value was<0.05. 
Results 
Clinical characteristics of the study participants 
This study enrolled 70 gingivitis participants, of which  seven dropped out, who missed the recall time due to  closed management amid COVID-19 outbreak. Thirty three control and 30 experimental participants attended  all recall visits. The baseline clinical characteristics are  shown in Table 1. Demographics, gingival, and halitosis  parameters were similar between the groups (p > 0.05).  No adverse reaction including gingival recession reported  during the 12-week experimental period in terms of water  fossing. 
Efects of water fossing on clinical parameters 
The efects of water fossing on periodontal parameters, den tal plaque index, and oral malodor were assessed. Two-way  RM-ANOVA identiied time and group as statistically sig niicant factors (p<0.05) in the gingival index, sulcus bleed ing index, and BOP% (Table 2). These indices improved  signiicantly in both groups at all observation time points  (weeks 4, 8, 12) compared with baseline (p<0.05). How ever, the improvement in the control group slowed after  4 weeks. Gingival index and sulcus bleeding index at weeks  8 and 12 were signiicantly better in the experimental than in  the control group, and BOP% improved signiicantly in the  experimental group at weeks 8 as compared with the control  group (Table 2). These results suggest that water fossing

had a good clinical efect on managing gingival bleeding  and infammation. 
Two-way RM-ANOVA of the dental plaque index identi ied time as a statistically signiicant factor (p<0.05), with  signiicant diferences among time points (Table 2). How ever, the control and experimental groups did not difer at  any time point (Table 2). There was no signiicant diference  in the oral malodor values between groups after the use of  the respective oral hygiene regimens (Table 2). However, the  value was signiicantly decreased after 12-week water foss ing as compared with that at baseline in the experimental  group (Table 2). 
Efects of water fossing on dental plaque  microbiota 
The 16S rRNA sequencing data are detailed in the sup plementary information (Fig. S1). In total, 20.71 million  high-quality 16S rRNA sequences were generated from the  supragingival plaque samples of 33 control and 30 experi mental participants at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks (length range  408–480 bp, average length 464.36 bp). After subsampling  each sample to equal sequencing depth and clustering, 6442  OTUs with 97% identity were obtained. Good’s coverage for  the observed OTUs was 99.72±0.09%, and the rarefaction  curves showed clear asymptotes, which together indicated a  near-complete sampling of the community. 
The α and β diversity of the baseline dental plaque  samples showed no signiicant diference between the two  groups, suggesting that the baseline dental plaque microbiota  structure of the two groups was comparable (Fig. S2A and B).  Although the PCoA analysis showed no signiicant diference  in the microbiota community structure between the groups,  the p value approximated 0.05 (p=0.056). NMDS analysis  revealed a signiicant diference between the groups (p=0.012)  (Fig.  S2C). PCoA and NMDS analyses demonstrated  signiicant diferences between the control and experimental  groups at week 12 (PCoA: p=0.038, NMDS: p=0.029), and  samples could be clearly distinguished and clustered into two  groups (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that, after 12 weeks,  the dental plaque microbiota of the two groups were distinct,  suggesting that water fossing changed the microbial structure. 
Further analysis of the top 30 abundant bacterial taxa  revealed genus-level diferences between the control and  water-fossing groups (Fig. 2B). The abundance of Aggre gatibacter, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium increased over time in the control, but not in the experi mental group (Fig. 2B). There was no signiicant diference  in the top 15 most abundant bacterial taxa between groups  at baseline (Fig. 2D). However, after 12 weeks, the water fossing group exhibited signiicantly lower Prevotella and  higher Corynebacterium genus as compared with the con trol group (Fig. 2C, E). qPCR showed no diference in the  
relative abundance of Porphyromonas gingivalis, F. nuclea tum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans between the groups at  weeks 4 or 12, as compared to baseline, but the abundance  of Prevotella intermedia in the experimental group was sig niicantly lower at week 12 than week 4 or that in the control  group at week 12 (Fig. 2F). 
The BugBase phenotype prediction showed no signii cant diference in the seven metabolic phenotypes between  the control and experimental groups at baseline (Fig. 3A).  At week 4, the water-fossing group exhibited signiicantly  higher aerobic phenotype, while the control group exhibited  signiicantly higher anaerobic and gram-negative phenotypes  (Fig. 3B). At week 12, the water-fossing group still exhib ited signiicantly higher aerobic phenotype, while the control  group exhibited signiicantly higher anaerobic phenotype  (Fig. 3C). These data further suggest that water fossing may  beneit periodontal health by altering the microbial composi tion and reducing the virulence of the dental plaque. 
Discussion 
Gingivitis is a typical plaque-related oral diseases, and plaque  control has been proved to be an efective way to prevent and  treat this disease. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated  that water flossing can ameliorate gingival inflammation  by removing dental plaque [25, 39, 40]. Although relatively  easy and safe to apply as a daily oral hygiene instruction, the  ecological impact of water fossing on oral microbiota after  long-term use has yet to be investigated. In addition, as oral  malodor is usually accompanied with periodontal diseases  including gingivitis and periodontitis, whether or not water  fossing can beneit oral malodor control still needs clinical  validation. Here, we performed a prospective clinical trial to  investigate the efects of water fossing on plaque accumulation,  gingival infammation, and halitosis, as well as the ecological  impact on supragingival plaque microbiota in a duration of  12-week application. We demonstrate that water fossing is an  efective adjuvant to control gingival infammation. 
Water fossing promotes gingival health by facilitating  removal of dental plaque. Here, we found that both water flossing and toothbrushing groups exhibited ameliorated  gingival infammation as refected by gingival index, sulcus  bleeding index, and BOP%. More importantly, the gingival  and sulcus bleeding indices in the water-fossing group were  lower than those in toothbrushing control at 8 and 12 weeks,  indicating that adjunctive application of water flossing  to toothbrushing can better promote periodontal health.  Consistently, several randomized controlled trials found that  the addition of a water fosser to toothbrush could signiicantly  reduce the BOP, gingival index, and plaque index at 4-week  compared with the toothbrush alone [39, 41]. Of note,  although both groups exhibited signiicantly reduced plaque

accumulating as refected by dental plaque index, no signiicant  between-group diference in dental plaque index was observed  in this study. Studies also demonstrated that although use of  water fosser plus manual toothbrushing signiicantly reduced  the plaque index at 8-week compared with that at baseline, no  between-group diference was achieved [42, 43]. The possible  explanation is that dental plaque may have reformed overnight  as the participants were instructed not to brush, foss, or eat  for 4 h prior to sample collection. Moreover, the participants  received good oral hygiene instruction and supervision during  the study, and this may overwhelm the diferences in dental  plaque accumulation between the adjunctive water-fossing  group and toothbrushing control group. 
As water fossing is a well-recognized oral hygiene technique  via active agitation and removal of supragingival dental plaque,  whether its daily use may pose long-term disturbance on oral  microecology is worth clinical validation. Here, we observed  an altered microbial structure and composition after 12-week  use of the respective oral hygiene regimens. More importantly,  we also observed that periodontal anaerobes, such as P.  intermedia, was depleted in the water-fossing group, while  this anaerobe increased in toothbrushing control during the  12-week study. P. intermedia, known as “orange complex”  species, is associated with gingivitis and periodontitis [44].  P. intermedia can stimulate the release of proteinases, matrix  metalloproteinases, and proinfammatory cytokines, and favors  the colonization of red complex species (i.e., P. gingivalis,  Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia), triggering dental  plaque dysbiosis and contributing to gingival infammation,  and eventually periodontitis [35, 44]. Consistently, we found  that the oral microbiota of individuals using water fossing was  
  

prone to an aerobic phenotype, while the oral microbiota of  the toothbrushing control was characterized with anaerobic  and gram-negative phenotypes. Periodontal pathogens are  mostly gram-negative anaerobes, enrichment of which can  shift the composition and structure of the microbial community,  leading to a breakdown of the normal homeostatic state [45].  It is speculated that water fossing may increase the presence  of oxygen in the dental plaque, and thus favor the outgrowth  of aerobes over anaerobic species. In addition, we also found  that Corynebacterium genus was increased after 12-week use  of water fosser. Corynebacterium genus is an important bridge  organism in dental plaque, which is usually enriched in the  periodontal healthy group, and is negatively associated with  probe depth in patients with chronic periodontitis [46, 47]. Our  indings indicate that water fossing may beneit gingival health  by altering microbial composition, preventing overgrowth of  oral pathobionts, and promoting anerobic phenotype of the  dental plaque. 
In addition to gingival infammation, oral malodor, which  is mainly derived from the metabolic production of volatile  sulfur compounds (VSCs) by periodontal anaerobes, is usually  accompanied with periodontal conditions such as periodontitis  and gingivitis [48, 49]. Although there still lacks clinical  evidence, it is conceivable that water fossing may help reduce  oral malodor by alleviating gingival infammation and reducing  oral anaerobes. The current study measured the halimeter score  of participants during the 12-week use of water fosser. We found  that participants in the water fossing group had signiicantly  lower oral malodor values at week 12 as compared to its baseline.  This may be accredited to the reduced anaerobes and relative  aerobic phenotype of dental plaque in the water fossing group.

In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that water  fossing can efectively alleviate gingival infammation and  reduce oral malodor, possibly by depleting oral anaerobes and  altering the oral microbiota to a more aerobic phenotype.
