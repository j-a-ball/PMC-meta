Abstract 
Cognitive impairment is one of the core symptoms of schizophrenia. Quite a number of systematic reviews were published  related to cognitive impairment in people with schizophrenia (PWS). This umbrella review, therefore, aimed at reviewing  and synthesizing the fndings of systematic reviews related to domains of cognition impaired and associated factors in PWS.  We searched four electronic databases. Data related to domains, occurrence, and associated factors of cognitive impairment  in PWS were extracted. The quality of all eligible systematic reviews was assessed using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess  methodological quality of systematic Review (AMSTAR) tool. Results are summarized and presented in a narrative form. We  identifed 63 systematic reviews fulflling the eligibility criteria. The included reviews showed that PWS had lower cognitive  functioning compared to both healthy controls and people with afective disorders. Similar fndings were reported among  psychotropic free cases and people with frst episode psychosis. Greater impairment of cognition was reported in process ing speed, verbal memory, and working memory domains. Greater cognitive impairment was reported to be associated with  worse functionality and poor insight. Cognitive impairment was also reported to be associated with childhood trauma and  aggressive behaviour. According to our quality assessment, the majority of the reviews had moderate quality. We were able  to fnd a good number of systematic reviews on cognitive impairment in PWS. The reviews showed that PWS had higher  impairment in diferent cognitive domains compared to healthy controls and people with afective disorders. Impairment in  domains of memory and processing speed were reported frequently.

Introduction 
Cognitive function is a mental process which involves sev eral intellectual abilities such as perception, reasoning, and  remembering, while cognitive impairment is the malfunction  of cognition or intellectual abilities [1]. Cognitive impair ment in people with schizophrenia (PWS) can be consid ered as part of core symptoms of the disorder because: (1)  almost all (98%) PWS showed cognitive decrement com pared to their premorbid state [2], (2) PWS showed a broader

domains of cognitive impairment with varying severity per  domain [3], and (3) cognitive impairment is seen in PWS  who are not taking anti-psychotic drugs [4]. 
Cognitive impairment in PWS was recognized from  as early as the time of Emil Kraepelin, where Kraepelin  named the disorder as dementia praecox to mean early-onset  dementia (although due attention has not been given to it)  [5]. However, diferent groups are now working to improve  cognitive impairment in PWS as part of the intervention  for the problem [6, 7]. One of these groups is the Meas 
urement And Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in  Schizophrenia (MATRICS) initiative [6]. The MATRICS  initiative, through review of factor analytical studies and  consensus, identifed seven domains of cognition which are  more afected in PWS [8]. Brief description of each of these  domains is given below (Table 1). 
A large number of articles are published on cognitive  impairment in PWS. A simple hit of “Cognition AND  Schizophrenia” in PubMed yields around 30,000 articles.  Consequently, quite a number of systematic reviews have  been published on the subject. Although there are numerous  systematic reviews on the magnitude of cognitive domains  impaired and associated factors in PWS, we found only one  published umbrella review on the subject [9]. However, this  umbrella review has not addressed factors associated with  cognitive impairment; and it only focused on the diference  in the magnitude of cognitive impairment between PWS and  people with bipolar disorder. 
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental dis orders (DSM) [5] and the International Classifcation of  Diseases (ICD) [10] have not, to date, considered cognitive  impairment in their diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia.  Whereas, cognitive impairment seems to be one of the core  symptoms of this illness. In this umbrella review, we aimed  
to explore the evidence that cognitive impairment maybe a  common problem in PWS by examining fndings from sys tematic reviews and meta-analysis related to magnitude of  cognitive domains impaired and associated factors in PWS.  This umbrella review might help clinicians and experts in  the area to have a comprehensive understanding of domains  of cognition afected, and related factors in PWS. Addition ally, this review would inform future researchers regarding  which factors need to be considered while planning stud ies involving cognitive impairment in PWS. This umbrella  review, therefore, aimed at synthesizing the evidence on  magnitude of cognitive domains impaired and associated  factors in PWS from systematic review studies. 
Methods 
We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic  Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline to iden tify, search, extract articles, and report this umbrella review  [11]. 
Databases searched 
We searched major databases, including PubMed, Embase,  PsycINFO, and Global Index Medicus from the date of  inception of each database until July 05, 2018. An update  search from the same databases was conducted on 13th  August 2020. Google Scholar was used for forward and  backward searching.

Search strategy 
We used the following three key words: schizophrenia,  Cognition, and Magnitude/Associated factors. Free terms  and controlled vocabulary terms were used for those three  big terms. We combined those three big terms with the  Boolean term “AND”. The term systematic review was  not included in the initial search to allow collection of  systematic reviews that did not mention systematic review  in their title or abstract, however, we later fltered each  databases for review or systematic review or meta-analysis  or other related terms according to the flter method of  the database. For the complete search strategy, see online  resource 1. To increase our chance of capturing all system atic reviews about the magnitude and associated factors of  cognitive impairment in PWS, we conducted a forward and  backward search. 
Eligibility criteria 
This umbrella review considered reviews that aimed at  assessing domains of cognitive impairment and associated  factors among adult PWS aged 18 years and older. Diag noses needed to have been confrmed using either DSM  [5], ICD [10], or other recognized diagnostic criteria. For  studies with mixed populations at least 50% of the partici pants should be PWS. 
We included any systematic reviews or meta-analysis  which addressed concepts related to magnitude and/or  associated factors of at least one full domain of cognition  in PWS. If the review was about sub-domains of a single  domain then that review was excluded. 
We only included systematic review studies. In this  review, systematic review was operationalized as any  review which had a search term, searched at least one  database, had eligibility criteria to include studies, and  reported the fndings systematically [12]. We employed  such a stringent defnition of systematic review, because  there were numerous unstructured reviews, expert com 
ments, editorials, overviews, guidelines, and other non systematic reviews on the subject. 
No restriction was employed in terms of settings of the  systematic reviews. However, systematic reviews pub lished only in English were included into this umbrella  review. 
Full‑text identifcation process 
We merged the articles we found from the databases and  removed duplicates. The frst author (YG) screened each  article for eligibility using their title and abstract, followed  by full-text screening. While, another author (AM) screened  
10% of the articles and we found good agreement. Same pro cedure was employed in screening articles obtained through  forward and backward search. 
Data extraction 
The frst author (YG) extracted data from the included arti cles using a data extraction tool developed a priori. Another  author (AM) checked a randomly selected articles for correct  extraction using the same extraction tool. The extraction tool  was developed referring to previous published systematic  reviews, and the requirements for quality assessment in con sultation with the other co-authors. This was followed by  piloting it on two articles (the data extraction template is in  online resource 2). The core components of the data extrac tion tool include authors’ detail, databases searched, number  of included studies, total number of participants included,  cognitive domains addressed, and fndings about cognitive  impairment and associated factors. 
Risk of bias/quality assessment 
The frst author (YG) and another author (AM) assessed  the quality of each review using a critical appraisal form  designed for evaluating the methodological quality of  systematic reviews: a measurement tool to assess meth 
odological quality of systematic Review (AMSTAR) [13].  AMSTAR has eleven items each to be scored as one for  “yes” and zero for “no”. The eleven items focused on the  presence of a prior registration of the protocol, study identi 
fcation process, quality assessment section, and other steps  of conducting a review. A score of 8 or more is considered as  a good-quality review, a score of 4 to 7 a moderate quality,  and a score below 4 a poor-quality review. 
Data synthesis 
We used a narrative synthesis to report the fndings in this  review. A narrative synthesis approach was selected as this  approach is more appropriate to summarize studies with het erogeneous outcomes. For each systematic review included,  we have reported the databases searched, number of included  studies, total number of participants in each group (if more  than one group was involved), specifc cognitive domains  evaluated, and fndings related to magnitude and associ ated factors of cognitive impairment. We have also reported  methodological qualities of each review included. We have  presented the fndings considering the methodological qual ity of the reviews included.

Results 
Study characteristics 
The search yielded a total of 7734 articles (i.e., 6607 articles  in the initial search and 1127 on the updated search). Title  and abstract screening yielded 87 articles, while full-text  screening, and forward and backward searching gave us 63  systematic reviews (Fig. 1). A list of excluded articles after  full-text screening with the reason for their exclusion is pro 
vided in online resource 3. 
All the included systematic reviews evaluated cogni tive impairment and associated factors in PWS with no  geographical restriction, except one review from China. A  diverse group of mental disorders were included in each  review. In all the reviews, PWS were either compared  within schizophrenia group or with other population groups,  such as people with afective disorder or healthy controls.  The majority of the reviews searched both PubMed and  PsycINFO databases (n=39). The quality of most of the  included reviews was moderate (n=38). We identifed the  following four themes from analysis of the data extracted  from the included reviews. 
1. Domains of cognition impaired in PWS from specifc  single cognitive domain reviews (n=15/63) 
2. Comparison of cognitive impairment in PWS with  diferent groups from reviews with multiple domains  (n=17/63) 
3. Course/progress of cognitive impairment in PWS over  time (n=6/63) 
4. Cognitive impairment in PWS and associated factors  (n=25/63) 
Domains of cognition impaired in PWS from specifc  single cognitive domain reviews 
We identified a total of 15 systematic reviews which  assessed the magnitude of cognitive impairment in PWS in  a specifc single cognitive domain. Five assessed memory,  four executive function, two processing speed, two verbal  fuency, and two social cognition. These reviews were pub 
lished between 1999 and 2019. The majority of the reviews  (n=9/15) searched both PubMed and PsycINFO, and they  included from 10 to 124 independent studies (1 review did  not report the number of studies included). Ten of the 15  systematic reviews had moderate quality, while the remain 
ing fve studies had poor quality. Detailed description of the  reviews included are given in (Table 2). 
The most frequently studied domain of cognition is mem ory; 5 of the 15 systematic reviews [14–18] included were  about diferent kinds of memory impairment in PWS. In  
all types of memory examined (spatial working memory,  short-term and long-term memory, working memory, epi sodic memory, and semantic memory), PWS were found to  have more impairment compared to healthy controls. The  second most commonly studied domain was executive func tion. Four systematic reviews [19–22] included were about  the level of impairment in executive function in PWS. All  the four reviews reported that PWS had greater impairment  in executive function compared to healthy controls. Two  reviews [23, 24] were on processing speed. These reviews  found that PWS had greater impairment in processing speed  compared to controls. The level of impairment of verbal  fuency was examined in two systematic reviews [25, 26],  which found that PWS were more impaired in verbal fuency  compared to healthy controls. Semantic fuency was reported  to be more impaired in PWS compared to letter/phonetic  fluency. Finally, other two systematic reviews [27, 28]  included under this sub-section examined social cognition.  Both reviews disclosed that in all domains of social cogni 
tion PWS performed worse compared to controls (Fig. 2). 
Comparison of cognitive impairment in PWS  with diferent groups from reviews with multiple  domains 
A total of 17 systematic reviews compared the magnitude  of cognitive impairment in PWS with diferent groups in  multiple domains of cognition. Of these, fve reviews com pared cognitive impairment in PWS and people with bipolar  disorder/afective disorders and healthy controls; four com pared cognitive impairment in PWS with healthy controls  only. Five systematic reviews compared cognitive impair ment in frst episode/drug-free PWS with healthy controls.  One review compared cognitive impairment in frst episode  schizophrenia patients with frst episode bipolar patients  and healthy controls. Two reviews compared cognitive  domains to one another. Except for one which was rated as  a good review, all the other reviews were of moderate quality  
(n=12/17) or poor quality (n=4/17) (Table 3). From the reviews that compared cognitive impairment  in PWS and people with bipolar disorder or other afective  disorders, we found that PWS had signifcantly higher cog nitive impairment compared to both people with bipolar  disorder, or other afective disorders, and healthy controls,  whereas people with bipolar disorder had intermediate cog nitive impairment compared with PWS and healthy controls  [29–33]. Regarding impairment in specifc domains, one  review [31], reported that greater impairment was observed  in verbal fuency, whereas no diference was reported in the  domains of delayed verbal memory, and fne motor skill  between PWS and people with bipolar disorder. Similarly,  another review [30] found that there was no signifcant group  diference in the domains of verbal memory, attention (digit

impairment with executive function impairment reported  that PWS had greater impairment in both domains and  theory of mind continued to predict schizophrenia (rather  than being a control participant) once executive function  was controlled for. This review supported the hypothesis that  theory of mind and executive function impairments in PWS  are independent of one another. 
Course/ progress of cognitive impairment in PWS  over time 
Six of the systematic reviews we identifed were about the  course of cognitive impairment in PWS [44–49]. Methodo

domains of processing speed and memory, whereas lower  impairment was reported in domains of language and Intel ligence Quotient (IQ) [34, 36]. 
We found that people with frst episode schizophrenia  were more impaired compared to healthy controls in mul tiple domains [37–40]. In the domain of verbal memory,  greater impairment was reported in two reviews [37, 40].  Compared to people with frst episode bipolar disorder cases  and healthy controls, people with frst episode schizophrenia  were found to have worse performance while, people with  bipolar disorder were reported to have cognitive impairment  worse than healthy controls [41]. Similarly, in one system atic review of studies on cognitive impairment among treat ment naive PWS [4], it was reported that PWS performed  worse compared to healthy controls in all the domains con sidered, the three domains with greater impairment were  verbal memory, processing speed, and working memory.  These systematic reviews confrmed that cognitive impair ment in PWS occurred in the absence of medication (i.e.,  antipsychotics). 
Finally, two reviews focused on the relationship among  the diferent cognitive domains. One of the two reviews  [42] examined the relationship between theory of mind and  neurocognitive domains. This review reported moderate  association between theory of mind and each neurocogni 
tive domain (Zrs 0.27–0.43), with no signifcant diference  among domains in the neurocognitive domain. In the same  review, stronger association was reported between theory  of mind and executive function and abstraction domains.  While the second review [43] that compared theory of mind  
logically, two reviews were rated as poor and the other four  were rated as moderate quality (Table 4). 
Only one review [44] reported cognitive function decline  over time. Even this review reported mixed results with  slightly more studies pointing towards decline with a 1 to  1.2 ratio of no decline vs decline. This review was rated as  poor quality with our criteria. To the contrary, two moder 
ate-quality reviews [45, 46] reported no decline in cogni tive function of PWS from follow-up studies. Most of the  included studies in this review showed no diference between  those treated with typical and atypical antipsychotics; among  various atypical antipsychotics, and between medicated and  un-medicated participants in terms of cognitive impairment  [46]. One systematic review [47], which is a poor-quality  review, reported improvement in cognitive function over  time. 
Two reviews [48, 49] examined the course of IQ in PWS,  and both reviews found that PWS had lower performance in  IQ test compared to controls. In both reviews, mixed results  (i.e., both decline over time and no decline) were reported,  where no decline over time was reported in better quality  studies. 
Cognitive impairment in PWS and associated factors 
Twenty-fve reviews focused on cognitive impairment in  PWS and associated factors such as functionality, symptom  dimensions, substance use, age of patients, insight into their  problem, childhood trauma, duration of untreated psychosis,  treatment, and aggressive behaviour. Seven of the 25 reviews  examined the relationship between cognitive impairment and  functionality, while four of them evaluated the relationship  between cognitive impairment and substance use. Other  four reviews examined the relationship between cognitive  impairment and insight and two others each examined the  relationship between cognitive impairment and symptom  dimensions, duration of untreated psychosis, treatment, and  childhood trauma. One review each examined the relation ship between cognitive impairment and age, and aggressive

CIPWS cognitive impairment in people with schizophrenia, HC healthy controls, NR not reported, IQ intelligence quotient, PWS people with  schizophrenia 
behaviour (Fig. 3). Twelve of the 25 systematic reviews were  moderate quality, while two were high quality (Table 5). As shown in (Fig. 3), the relationship between cognitive  impairment in PWS and functionality was examined in seven  systematic reviews [50–56]. One good-quality review [50]  concluded that there was no association between cognition  and functional outcome. However, the other six reviews  [51–56] found some association between diferent domains  of cognition and diferent aspects of functionality. Three of  these reviews were poor quality, two moderate quality, and  one good-quality review (Fig. 3 and Table 5). Four reviews [57–60] examined the relationship between  substance use and cognitive impairment in PWS. These  reviews reported inconsistent fndings. The efect of sub stance use in cognitive impairment in PWS difered from  substance to substance, and from domain to domain (Fig. 3 and Table 5). 
Four reviews that examined the association between  cognitive impairment in PWS and insight [61–64] reported  mixed findings. One poor-quality review [62] reported  inconsistent results, with more studies reporting no asso 
ciation between insight and neurocognition. While the other  three reported a signifcant relationship between poor insight  and worse cognitive performance both in neurocognitive and  
social cognitive domains [61, 63, 64], with stronger relation ship in some sub-domains of social cognition (such as theory  of mind) [64] (Fig. 3 and Table 5). 
With regards to the relationship between cognitive  impairment and symptom dimensions, two reviews [65, 66]  were included in the umbrella review. These reviews found  that cognitive impairment was associated with negative  symptoms and disorganized symptoms compared to positive  symptoms and depressive symptoms (Fig. 3 and Table 5). 
Two reviews examined the relationship between cognition  and duration of untreated psychosis [67, 68]. One of these  had poor quality and the other one moderate quality. Both  concluded that there was no signifcant association between  most neurocognition domains and duration of untreated psy 
chosis, with the exception of general intellectual function,  executive function, and trial making test A and B (Fig. 3 and Table 5). 
Two reviews examined the relationship between child hood trauma and cognitive impairment in PWS [69, 70].  Both reviews reported signifcant association between higher  rates of childhood trauma and reduced overall cognitive per formance; one of these reviews was poor quality and the  other one was moderate quality (Fig. 3 and Table 5).

Two reviews [71, 72] were about the relationship between  cognitive impairment and treatment. One of these reviews  [71] was about the effect of cognitive impairment on  response to diferent forms of treatment. In this review, it  was shown that improvement over several evidence-based  treatments were linked with baseline measures of cogni 
tive function. The other review was comparing the efect  of typical and atypical antipsychotics in treating cognitive  impairment in PWS [72]. This review reported that atypi cal antipsychotics signifcantly improved cognitive function  compared to conventional antipsychotics. This review also  concluded that the studies that were included had many  methodological limitations that one needs to consider in  
interpreting the fndings (Fig. 3 and Table 5). One of the reviews we included [73] dealt with the associ ation between cognitive impairment and age. The study con cluded that age had direct efect on the score of mini-mental  state examination (MMSE); for every four years increase  in age of PWS, there was one MMSE point reduction (fve  times higher than the report in the general population). PWS  living in institutions were more impaired compared to those  who were living in the community. This was of a poor-qual ity review (Fig. 3 and Table 5).

The other review included under this section examined  the association between cognitive impairment in PWS and  aggressive behaviour [74]. This moderate-quality review  concluded that cognitive impairment in PWS exerted a sig 
nifcant risk for aggression (Fig. 3 and Table 5). 
Discussion 
Multiple studies have been published on the magnitude of  cognitive impairment in PWS and associated factors. We  were able to identify 63 independent reviews, and the major ity addressed several neurocognitive domains. Most of the  reviews used PubMed and PsycINFO databases to search  their included studies. Methodologically, the majority of the  studies were of moderate quality. 
Of the 63 reviews we identified, some (n = 24) were  included in a previous umbrella review of the magnitude  of cognitive dysfunction in PWS and people with bipolar  disorder [9]. The diference between our review and this  previous umbrella review is that, the former only included  meta-analysis studies while our review included both meta 
analysis and systematic reviews. This previous review was

not specifc to cognitive impairment in PWS rather it was an  umbrella review of cognitive impairment in PWS and people  with bipolar disorder. It also focused more on comparing  the domains of cognitive impairment in PWS and people  with bipolar disorder. The previous review only included  meta-analysis of neurocognitive domains, ignoring social  cognitive domains, which is considered to be an important  predictor of functionality. Finally, the previous review was  not comprehensive (searched PubMed only) and the last date  of search for the previous umbrella review was on August  10th 2015 (5 years older than ours). These facts make our  review more comprehensive compared to it. 
Even though the area is extensively researched, none of  the included reviews reported the problem from low and  middle-income countries (LMICs), separately. Since there  are reports which show that cognition can be afected by  nutritional status [75], we expect diferent results in high 
income countries compared to that of LMICs. This calls for  a separate analysis of the magnitude of cognitive impairment  and associated factors based on income level of countries.  One of the reasons for the lack of separate analysis may be  scarcity of studies from LMICs. Therefore, conducting stud 
ies focusing on the magnitude, associated factors, and other  interventional studies might be worth considering. In this umbrella review, we found that PWS have more  severe cognitive impairment compared to both healthy con trols, people with bipolar disorder, and people with other  afective disorders, particularly in the domains of processing  speed, verbal memory, and working memory. We also found  that the magnitude of cognitive impairment is more or less  the same in PWS who were drug free and frst episode psy chosis, and those who had taken pharmacological treatment.  Even though the results were mixed, most of the reviews we  included point toward no decline of cognitive impairment  in PWS over time. These fndings support the hypothesis  that cognitive impairment is one of the core symptoms of  schizophrenia even at the initial phase of the illness. This review of reviews showed that cognitive impair ment in PWS has signifcant association with a number  of factors, including functionality, substance use, insight,  symptom dimensions, history of childhood trauma, older  age, and aggressive behaviour. Hence, we recommend future  researchers to consider these factors in conducting a study  related to factors associated with cognitive impairment in  PWS. 
This umbrella review is particularly useful for research ers, clinicians, and experts in the area. The implication of  this review for research is that it would help researchers in  identifying a summary of factors that are potentially asso ciated with cognitive impairment in PWS when planning  studies. This study will also have implication for interven tional studies that future researchers may design focusing  on domains reported to be impaired. Another potential  
implication of this review is for experts in the area. Experts  can refer this review in designing policy and strategies  related to cognition in PWS. Clinicians can refer to this  review to have a comprehensive understanding of domains  of cognition afected and factors associated with cognitive  impairment in PWS. 
This review has a number of strengths in that we followed  PRISMA guideline in conducting and reporting the review.  Our search can be considered more comprehensive com pared to the one conducted before since we included four  databases without restriction on the date of publication, and  we also conducted forward and backward searching. Fur thermore, we assessed the quality of each of the included  reviews, and whenever possible results were presented sepa rately considering the methodological quality of the reviews  included. 
However, our review is not free from limitations. First,  the broad scope of the review made the data analysis dif cult, particularly to conduct meta-analysis. The broad scope  of the review allowed a wide variety of study outcomes to be  included and hence made the review hard to follow. Second,  non-English studies were excluded, which might limit the  generalizability of the fndings. Finally, the grey literature  was not searched; however, we used Google Scholar for our  forward and backward searching. 
Conclusions 
This umbrella review highlights cognition as an important  factor contributing to functionality and insight in PWS. Con sidering the presence of 63 diferent reviews and no review  looked for cognitive diference across the economic clas sifcation, we encourage reviews that compare cognitive  impairment in PWS at diferent income settings. From this  umbrella review, one can conclude that cognitive impair ment is a core symptom in PWS and diferent factors such  as functionality, insight, history of childhood trauma, age,  and aggressive behavior have signifcant association with  cognitive impairment in this population group.
